# TrustBench Development Milestones

TrustBench is an independent Python learning and portfolio project exploring reproducible evaluation of AI-generated responses. Development is incremental: implement a small feature, understand its behavior, test it, and then extend it.

**Current status:** Milestones 1, 2, and 3 implemented, tested (47 automated tests), and merged into `main` on October 21, 2026. Milestones 4 and 5 remain planned.

## Guiding principles

- **Write and understand the implementation.** Use official documentation, experiments, and code review to learn; do not treat generated code as evidence of independently acquired skills.
- **Preserve functionality.** Keep the working Milestone 1 output and behavior when refactoring, unless a behavior change is explicitly required and tested.
- **Be precise about metrics.** “Accuracy” is normalized exact-match rate among scored responses in the provided test dataset, not a measurement of a model's general accuracy, factuality, safety, or fairness. Live HTTP/network/timeout errors are counted separately and excluded from the denominator.
- **Build reproducibly.** Document inputs, dependencies, assumptions, expected results, and known limitations.
- **Mark work complete only after testing.** Do not represent planned work as implemented in the README or on a resume.

## Milestone 1: Basic evaluation and normalization

**Status: Complete.** The original prototype has since been extended. The current `eval.py` reads `eval-read-valid.json` by default and accepts an optional file path.

### Implemented

- [x] Read an array of test cases from a JSON file using Python's standard library.
- [x] Iterate through the cases and compare each `expected` answer with its prerecorded `response`.
- [x] Normalize both strings with `.lower()` and `.strip()` before comparing.
- [x] Print a PASS/FAIL result alongside each test ID.
- [x] Count passing and failing cases, including correct singular/plural output.
- [x] Calculate and round the pass percentage to two decimal places.
- [x] Return `Accuracy: N/A` for a valid empty list (`[]`) rather than dividing by zero.

### Manually verified cases

- Equal answers such as `Paris` and `Paris` pass.
- Whitespace and case differences such as `Paris` and `  PARIS  ` pass.
- Different answers such as `60` and `45` fail.
- The three-case sample produces 2 passes, 1 failure, and 66.67 accuracy.
- A valid empty JSON array produces 0 passes, 0 failures, and `Accuracy: N/A`.

### Scope limitations

- Milestone 1 itself evaluated prerecorded responses only; Milestone 3 later added a separate live evaluator (`eval_live.py`).
- Matching remains exact after normalization: `Paris` and `The capital is Paris.` do not match.
- The current evaluator handles missing files, malformed JSON, and invalid dataset structure with errors and a nonzero exit status.
- The original `eval.py` remains offline-only; model comparisons and an evaluation database are not implemented.

**Acceptance:** Existing functionality and the above manually verified behaviors are preserved on the stable branch.

## Milestone 2: Testable architecture and automated testing

**Goal:** Make the existing evaluator easier to test and safer to run, without losing Milestone 1 features.

### Milestone 2A: Reusable Python functions

**Status: Complete.** Reusable functions separate comparison and accuracy calculations from CLI input/output.

#### Assignment

- [x] Create `compare_answers(expected, response)`, returning a Boolean.
- [x] Move the existing whitespace/case normalization into that function.
- [x] Call the function from the current evaluation loop rather than duplicating comparison logic.
- [x] Preserve individual test messages, totals, rounded percentage, and `N/A` for empty arrays.
- [x] Manually test equal, case-different, whitespace-different, and unequal answer pairs.

#### Acceptance criteria

- `compare_answers("Paris", "  PARIS  ")` returns `True`.
- `compare_answers("60", "45")` returns `False`.
- `compare_answers("Tokyo", "tokyo")` returns `True`.
- Running `python3 eval.py` with the Milestone 1 dataset still reports 2 passed, 1 failed, and 66.67 accuracy.
- The empty-array case still reports `Accuracy: N/A`.

### Milestone 2B: Automated unit tests with pytest

**Status: Complete.** Automated pytest tests cover answer matching and accuracy computation without running the CLI on import.

#### Assignment

- [x] Install `pytest` in a project-specific virtual environment and document the setup.
- [x] Add a `tests/` directory with tests for `compare_answers`.
- [x] Verify exact matches, case differences, leading/trailing whitespace, and nonmatches.
- [x] Test the empty-dataset behavior and accuracy calculation, refactoring into additional functions only when it improves testability.
- [x] Ensure importing functions for testing does not unintentionally execute the entire CLI script.
- [x] Run `python3 -m pytest` and document successful results.

#### Acceptance criteria

- Tests run repeatedly without manually changing input files between cases.
- A failing assertion causes the test run to fail.
- Existing CLI output and behaviors remain available and correct.

**Learning references:** [pytest getting started](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html), [Python modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html).

### Milestone 2C: Input validation and error handling

**Status: Complete.** Input validation and clean CLI errors are implemented and tested.

#### Assignment

- [x] Handle a missing `eval-read.json` file gracefully.
- [x] Handle blank and malformed JSON without displaying an unhandled traceback during normal CLI use.
- [x] Reject a non-list top-level JSON value with a useful message.
- [x] Check that each case has the required fields (`id`, `expected`, `response`) with appropriate types.
- [x] Decide and document the policy for an empty array versus an invalid dataset.
- [x] Add pytest cases covering both valid inputs and these failures.

#### Acceptance criteria

- Valid inputs still produce the Milestone 1 results.
- Invalid inputs produce clear errors and an appropriate nonzero process exit status.
- The evaluator does not silently count malformed cases as valid passes or failures.

## Milestone 3: Real AI model integration

**Status: Complete (implementation and local validation, October 21, 2026).** Added live evaluation against a **local Ollama model** while retaining offline evaluation of prerecorded fixtures.

### Implemented

- [x] Learned and used local HTTP POST requests, JSON request/response payloads, and a request timeout using Python's standard library (`urllib.request`).
- [x] Built `ollama_client.py` with `generate_response(prompt, model)` targeting Ollama's local `/api/generate` endpoint with `stream: false`.
- [x] Used the locally available `gemma3:1b` model without paid hosted API requests or credentials.
- [x] Added `eval_live.py`, with live dataset validation (`id`, `question`, `expected`; a prerecorded `response` is not required).
- [x] Reused `compare_answers` and `calculate_accuracy`, keeping `eval.py` usable for prerecorded answers.
- [x] Distinguished `PASS`/`FAIL` from `ERROR`, handling HTTP errors, network failures, and timeouts (including timeouts wrapped in `URLError`).
- [x] Kept API/network errors out of the accuracy denominator; represented accuracy as `None`/JSON `null` when no cases were scored.
- [x] Recorded model identifier, dataset filename, UTC timestamp, per-case prompt/expected/generated answers/status, error details where applicable, and per-request elapsed seconds.
- [x] Saved a new uniquely named JSON file for each run under ignored `reports/`, preserving previous reports.
- [x] Added filesystem/report-save failure handling and automated tests using mocked model calls.
- [x] Verified repeated real local runs and a complete suite of **47 passing pytest tests**.

### Completion evidence

- Commands: `ollama pull gemma3:1b` (first-time setup), then `python3 eval_live.py` from the repository root while Ollama is running; run `python3 -m pytest -v` for tests without requiring Ollama.
- Live sample: two simple prompts requesting `Paris` and `12`, both passing in observed runs. The evaluator records raw replies (including harmless surrounding whitespace) as well as scores.
- The reports contain `metadata`, `summary`, and `results`; durations were checked against terminal output and guarded by a deterministic regression test.
- Automated tests exercise HTTP, connection, and timeout failures, dataset errors, saved report contents, multiple report preservation, and report-saving failures.
- No paid API charges are required for the documented Ollama workflow. Model download and local CPU/RAM usage still apply.

### Current limitations / deferred work

- Live evaluation is currently configured in source for `gemma3:1b` and `eval-read-live.json`; it does **not** yet expose a general-purpose model selection or live dataset CLI argument.
- The connector uses a 120-second request timeout but does not implement retries, exponential backoff, hosted-provider authentication, or rate-limit policies. Those were learning topics in the initial plan, not completed features.
- The current report records model name and timing but not model weights hash, decoding settings, prompt templates, or dataset version hash.
- No multi-model comparisons, semantic scoring, factuality/safety metrics, or aggregated evaluation database yet.
- Saved reports are currently written directly; partial output cleanup on a mid-write failure is not implemented.

## Milestone 4: Responsible AI evaluation methods

**Status: Planned.** Develop narrow, defensible tests rather than claiming comprehensive AI safety coverage.

### Proposed work

- [ ] Build a small, documented factual-grounding dataset using known reference material.
- [ ] Introduce assessment methods beyond exact string matching, while explicitly documenting evaluator error.
- [ ] Explore controlled prompt-injection resilience cases that are safe to reproduce.
- [ ] Investigate consistency across repeated runs and categorize model failures.
- [ ] Identify cases requiring human judgment and record review criteria.
- [ ] Investigate bias and privacy testing only where the dataset and methodology support meaningful claims.

### Completion evidence

For each metric, document: what is tested, how a result is scored, examples of false positives/negatives, sample size, and limitations. Do not label a simple pass rate as “AI safety” or “hallucination rate” without validated measurement.

## Milestone 5: Reproducibility and reporting

**Status: Planned (advanced features).** Basic per-run JSON reports already exist from Milestone 3; cross-run comparisons and stronger reproducibility metadata remain future work.

### Proposed work

- [x] Save basic structured JSON run results (**implemented in Milestone 3**; CSV/SQLite remain optional future work).
- [ ] Compare runs against the same versioned test suite and evaluation rules.
- [ ] Summarize pass rates by category and retain examples of failures.
- [ ] Expand existing model-name/dataset-name/timestamp metadata to include model versions/configuration, dataset revision, and explicit scoring-rule version.
- [ ] Include sample sizes and uncertainty or limitations where appropriate.
- [ ] Publish a concise evaluation report, with clear instructions to reproduce it.

### Completion evidence

A reader can compare multiple runs using documented model/dataset/scoring versions, inspect individual cases and categories, understand the uncertainty and limitations, and reproduce the comparison without undocumented manual steps.

## Working practices and milestone completion

1. Begin new development on a feature branch of your choosing; branch creation is managed manually.
2. Implement a small change and run the existing example before adding the next change.
3. Add automated tests where applicable; preserve existing functionality throughout.
4. Update this file and the README when a milestone is genuinely completed.
5. Keep Git commits focused and include meaningful descriptions.

### Completed Milestone 2 evidence

- `compare_answers`, `calculate_accuracy`, and `validate_dataset` are importable and tested.
- The CLI accepts custom paths, produces clear input errors, and stops before scoring invalid datasets.
- `python3 -m pytest -v` runs 27 automated unit and CLI tests (26 originally completed, plus the CLI empty-array test).
- The default sample still produces 2 passes, 1 failure, and 66.67 accuracy.

### Completed Milestone 3 evidence

- `ollama_client.py` calls local Ollama, and `eval_live.py` evaluates model-generated answers without changing offline `eval.py` behavior.
- PASS/FAIL/ERROR outcomes, request durations, UTC timestamps, and raw generated responses are recorded in unique JSON reports.
- `tests/test_eval_live.py` and `tests/test_ollama_client.py` cover success paths, mocked request errors, timing, report persistence, and failure handling.
- **47 tests passed** on October 21, 2026; multiple local Ollama runs and JSON reports were also manually validated.

### Near-term next step

Milestone 3 is complete and merged into `main` (commit `18f4ded3`, October 21, 2026). Start Milestone 4 on a new feature branch with narrowly scoped, reproducible responsible AI evaluation exercises. Advanced cross-run comparison and additional reproducibility metadata remain planned for Milestone 5.
